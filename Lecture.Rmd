# Preamble {-}

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. In order to do so, you need to have R and RStudio installed. When this R notebook is loaded into RStudio, you can excecute chunks by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

This handout contains all output of the code (tables, visualisations etc.).

The following libraries will be needed and have to be installed.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggiraph)
library(cowplot)
library(emuR)
library(tools)
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
library(ggiraph)
library(htmltools)
library(shiny)
library(joeyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE )
```

This tutorial will demonstrate how to analyse audio data for phonetic studies in R. Topics covered are:
- phonetic databases, the case of emuR and EMU-SDMS
- provide a sample data base (subset of the LOD database)
- present the LOD database
- do queries
  requeries
- serve()
- overview of the database
  segments, categories
- calculate duration
- vowels formants
- Pillai distance

# LOD database
```{r}
db = load_emuDB("/Users/peter.gilles/Documents/_Daten/LOD-emuDB/lod_emuDB")
summary(db)
```

```{r}
list_ssffTrackDefinitions(db)
```

```{r}
list_attrDefLabelGroups(db, "MAU", "MAU")
```


# Vowel explorer
```{r}
knitr::include_app("https://petergill.shinyapps.io/shinyplay/")
```

# Calculate the Pillai distance
