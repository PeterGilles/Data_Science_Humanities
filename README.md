## Lecture: Big data in the acoustic phonetic analysis
April 14th, 2021
University of Luxembourg

This lecture will draw on the analysis of vowels for Luxembourgish using acoustic phonetics tools. In order to get a overview into acoustic phonetics, I refer to the chapter 27 on Phonetics in from 'Speech and Language Processing (3rd ed. draft)' by Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin, especially section 27.2, 27.5.4, 27.6. On the practical side, we will apply the R package emuR. Here, I am recommending the manual for (EMU-SDMS)https://ips-lmu.github.io/The-EMU-SDMS-Manual/. For the technical preparation, please install on your computer: R, RStudio and the R packages tidyverse and emuR. For the tutorial itself, I will send you a link to the Github repository in due time. You can then replicate the tasks on your own during the tutorial.

The generated HTML page of this tutorial is available [here](https://petergilles.github.io/Data_Science_Humanities/index.nb.html).

In case you want to replicate the code from the tutorial, copy/clone this repository and open the R notebook `Lecture.Rmd` in `RStudio`.
